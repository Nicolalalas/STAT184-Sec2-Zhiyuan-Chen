 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
Welcome to my repository! This repository contains my work on a recent assignment, which involved working with a specific dataset to analyze and draw meaningful conclusions. The main aim of this project was to learn and apply data analysis techniques, from data cleaning to generating visual outputs. The dataset used contains information on [briefly describe the data, e.g., sales transactions, customer information, etc.], and this repository showcases my entire process and findings.


In this assignment, I focused on several core tasks, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I used tools such as R with packages like dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualization. One of the challenges I faced was dealing with missing values in the dataset. My solution involved imputation techniques, such as filling missing values with the median for numerical data. Additionally, I implemented a custom function to categorize data based on certain attributes, which helped me gain better insights.

For example, the code below shows a portion of my data cleaning process:data <- read.csv('data.csv')
data$column_name[is.na(data$column_name)] <- median(data$column_name, na.rm = TRUE)
Overall, this assignment helped me better understand how to handle missing data and create informative visualizations.


If you have any questions or would like to discuss this work further, feel free to reach out to me via my school email: zjc5299@psu.edu. I am always open to collaboration and networking opportunities!
